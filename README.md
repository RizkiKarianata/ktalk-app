## 💾 Requirements

* `Web Server` - used to manage the entire application development process. Example [Xampp, Lampp, Mamp] and using PHP version 7.2 or higher
* `Web Browser` - can be used as a testing API to build applications. Example [Chrome, Firefox, Safari & Opera]
* `Internet` - because many use CDN and to make it easier to find solutions to all problems
* `Intl` - provides string comparison capabilities with support for appropriate locale-sensitive sort sort
* `Libcurl` - a library created by Daniel Stenberg, that allows you to connect and communicate to many different types of servers with many different types of protocols
* `Mbstring` - provides multibyte specific string functions that help you deal with multibyte encodings in PHP
* `Mysqlnd` - in the past, this was done by the extension using the services provided by the MySQL Client Library

## 🎯 How To Use

#### Using the built-in ready to use from the release (Recommended)

Download the latest project release from the [Release Page](https://github.com/RizkiKarianata/ktalk-app "Release Page"). Open the KTalk App project folder using a terminal and type `php spark serve`. To explore the source code you can use a text editor such as Visual Studio Code.

#### Build manually

* `composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter` then `composer update` whenever there is a new release of the framework
* When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from `vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`
* Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL and any database settings.
* `index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder, for better security and separation of components.
* To run the application you can run the command `php spark serve`. And the application will automatically open using port 8080 on your default browser

## 🤝 Contributing

<p>I really appreciate contributions, issues and feature requests because this application is far from perfect. Feel free to Pull Request and make changes to this project.</p>
<p>Since this is an open source project I finished it myself. There may be many features or things that could be improved or added. So I really appreciate your help.</p>

#### Steps To Contribute

* Fork it ( https://github.com/RizkiKarianata/ktalk-app )
* Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
* Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
* Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)

#### Notes To Contribute

Make sure to not commit generated files from your dist folder. All changes need to be made in the source files located in the `app` folder.

* Change the `js` files to adapt the application code

Always run a build and test the results before committing.
